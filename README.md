# NotesApp
Basic Note app using javaFX and sync with Evernote API 


This app uses the API of Evernote, I create a CRUD in the class Evernote, in this class you can see the methods to create, update and delete 
a note and sync the app and Evernote

The main funcionality is inside of ViewController class, I use tasks and Threads in order to improve the performance, so the ccode migth be
a bit confusing, so you can mail me if you are interested.
